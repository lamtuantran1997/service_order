# Service_Order
## Create a service order with the following requirements:
- Using Nestjs framework (use nestjs generator to create base, typescript is required)
- The main function is CR UD order (ResfulApi)
- Having middleware to authenticate token (token can be fake)
- Validating input (Dto validate in controller, interface in service)
- Using exceptions, filter decorator is a plus
- Building swagger (full of Htpp status codes, for example: what is the response for success, what is the response for error)
- Config environment variables in .env or .yaml . files
- Unit test coverage > 90%
- Using mongodb
